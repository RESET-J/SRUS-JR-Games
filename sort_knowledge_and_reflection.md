# In your own words, describe what sorting is in general. 
> Sorting is the process of arranging or rearanging elements in an list in an specific way or order, such as acsending / descending, for example sorting alphabetically would be sorting an list of values by ascending order, A, B, C, ect.., or if by descending C, B, A, ect...

# Research sorting algorithms. Describe advantages and disadvantages for at least three different sorting algorithms. Please provide references for external resources.

> ### Bubble Sort
> Bubble sort is an algorithm that sorts by comparing two elements that are adjacent, and then swaping them based on the comparison until they are all in the specified order

> Advantages - simple to understand, easy to impliment, the bubble sort algorithm swaps elements in place without using aditional temporary storage, this makes the space requirement low

> Disadvantages - This algorithm is not ideal for sorting large amounts of data, as the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) each element in the list will affect the preformance of this alorithm
